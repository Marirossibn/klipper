Welcome to the Klipper project!

This project implements a 3d-printer firmware. There are two parts to
this firmware - code that runs on a micro-controller and code that
runs on a host machine. The host software does the work to build a
schedule of events, while the micro-controller software does the work
to execute the provided schedule at the specified times.

Please see the [documentation](docs/Overview.md) for more information
on running and working with Klipper.
